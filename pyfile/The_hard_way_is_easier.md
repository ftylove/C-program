##The Hard Way Is Easier

```
With the help of the book, you will do the incredibly simple things that all programmers do the learn a
programming language:
	
	>
	1. Go through each exercise.
	2. Type in each sample exactly.
	3. Make it run.

That is it. This will be *very* difficult at first, but stick with it. If you go through this book, and do each
exercise for one or two hours a night, you will have a good foundation for moving onto another book
about Python to continue your studies. This book will not turn you into a programmer overnight, but it will 
get you started on the path to learning how to code.

This book's job to teach you the three most essential skills that a beginning programmer needs to
know: reading and writing, attention to detail, and spotting differences.
```

##Reading and Writing

```
if you have a problem typing, you will have a program learning to code, and especially if you have a 
problem typing the fairly odd characters in source code. Without this simple skill you will be unable to
learn even the most basic things about how software works.

Typing the code samples and getting them to run will help learn the names of the symbols, get 
familiar with typing them, and get you reading the language.
```

##Attention to Detail

```
The one skill that separates bad progrmmers fron good programmers is attention to detail. In fact, it's
what separates the good from the bad in any profession. You must pay attention to the tiniest details of
your work or you will miss important elements of what you create. In programming, this is how you end up
with bugs and diffcult-to-use systems.

By going through this book, and copying each example exactly, you will be training your brain to focus on
the details of what you are doing, as you are doing it.
```

##Spotting Differences

```
A very important skill(that most programmers develop pver time) is the ability to visually notice
differences between things. An experienced programmer can take two pieces of code that are slightly
different and immediately start pointing out the differences. Programmers have invented tools to make
this even easier, but we won't be using any of these. You first have to train your brain the hard way, then
use the tools.

While you do these exercises, typing each one in, you will be making mistakes. It's inevitable; even 
seasond programmers would make a few. Your job is to compare what you have writen to waht's required,
and fix all the differences. By doing so, you will traim yourself to notice mistakes, bugs, and other
problems.
