##Preface

```
This simple book is meant to get you started in programming. The title says it's the hard way to learn to
write code but it's actually not. It's only the "hard" way because it uses a technique called `instruction`.
Instruction is where I tell you to do a sequence of controlled exercises designed to build a skill through
repertition. This trchnique works very well with beginners who know noting and need to acquire basic skills
before they can understand more complex topics. It's used in everything from martial arts to music to even
basic math and reading skills.

This book instructs you in Python bu slowly building and establishing skills through techniques like
practite and mermioization, then applying then to increasingly diffcult problems. By the end of the book 
you will have the tools needed to begin learning more complex programming topics. Ilike to tell people
that my book gives you your "programming black belt." What this means is that you know the basics well 
enough to now start learning programming.

If you work hard, take your time, and build these skills, you will learn to code.

##Acknowledgements

```
I would like to thank Angela for helping me with the first two versions of this book. Without her probably
wouldn't have bothered to finish it at all. She did the copy-editing of the first draft and supported me
immensely while I wrote it.

I'd also like to thank Greg Newman for doing the original cover art, Brian Shumate for early website 
designs, and all of the people who read this book and took the time to send me facebook and corrections.

Thank you.
